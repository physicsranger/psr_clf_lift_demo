# A Demonstration of Ranking and Lift Using Pulsar Classification

A demonstration of lift and ranking in classification using a pulsar classification dataset.  For a more in-depth discussion of the dataset and the topics of ranking and lift, see my [medium post](https://medium.com/@tyrel.j.johnson/lets-talk-about-lift-e6c788c45629).
 
The dataset was originally obtained from [this Kaggle page](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/charitarth/pulsar-dataset-htru2/data).  There are actually several pages with the same dataset, but as I detail in the notebook it seems to have initially originated with [Lyon et al. (2016)](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/459/1/1104/2608953).

The notebook relies on fairly standard libraries as well as the [mplcyberpunk](https://github.com/dhaitz/mplcyberpunk) and dmba Python libraries (though only for the purposes of plotting and nicely displaying results).
